        <h1>The Do's and Don'ts of Auto Detailing</h1>
        <p>
          ** Whether you're an experienced detailer who needs a refresher or a beginner who's just starting today, 
          below are some quick do's - and - don'ts about detailing that everyone should know.

            <h2>DON'T: Use a towel or old rag to wipe down your car </h2>
            <p>
              Don't use a towel or rag to dry your car. This is because a traditional bath towel can actually
              damage your vehicle's paint. Instead, use a microfiber cloth or towel. A microfiber towel is 
              more absorbent than a traditional towel, and it will not leave swirls or scratches in your vehicle's 
              paint.

            <h2>DON'T: Wash your vehicle in direct sunlight</h2>
            <p>
              Don't wash your car in direct sunlight. The water and the soap will dry very quickly in the sun
              or on a hot surface. As a result, your vehicle may be left with water spots and some small swirl
              marks. Instead, try to wash your car early in the morning or later in the evening when the sun
              is not overhead. The best place to wash your car would be in doors or underneath the shade.

            <h2>DO: Use the appropriate cleaning products for your vehicle</h2>
            <p>
              A common misconception is that you can use dish soap or laundry detergent to wash your car.
              However, this is not the case. There are specially formulated chemicals that are meant to be 
              used to clean specific parts of your car. For example, to remove gunk from your wheels, use 
              degreaser. To clean the bottom of your car, use undercarriage spray.

            <h2>DO: Wash your towels often</h2>
            <p>
              Make sure to always wash your microfiber towels properly after use. This is because after 
              they are used, there may be dirt and grime on them. You don't want that dirt and grime on 
              your car the next time you do a wash. Make sure it's always clean. During use, make sure you 
              are using the 2 bucket method to ensure that your towels are as clean as possible.
