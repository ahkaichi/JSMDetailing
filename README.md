# JSM Detailing
CECS 470 Spring 2018  
This is a repository for my CECS 470 term project. The goal of this project was to develop a website for a *pro bono* client. Our team chose to develop a site for JSM Detailing, an automotive detailing business based in Frisco, Texas. For our solution, we came up with the implemented the following features - customer registration, customer login, and customer service ordering. The delivered solution can be found at the following link.

Through CSS media queries, the site will reformat depending on if the viewer is using a desktop, tablet, or mobile platform.
